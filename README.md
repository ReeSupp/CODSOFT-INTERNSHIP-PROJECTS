# Welcome to my Data Science Projects repository! Here, I showcase a collection of data-driven projects that I have completed during my internship at CODSOFT.

Task 1: TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION

Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not.
The dataset typically used for this project contains information
about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket
class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.

Task 2: IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION

Use the Iris dataset to develop a model that can classify iris
flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal
measurements. The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor,
and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their
measurements.

Task 3: CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION

Build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card
   transactions.

 Preprocess and normalize the transaction data, handle class
   imbalance issues, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Train a classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random
   forests, to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine.

 Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall,
   and F1-score, and consider techniques like oversampling or
   undersampling for improving results.
